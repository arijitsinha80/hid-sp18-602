     --scopes cloud-platform

Set up the kubectl command-line tool to use the container's credentials.

 gcloud container clusters get-credentials yelplabel

Enter the yelplabel directory, and run the command

    make all

As part of the process, a Docker image will be built and uploaded for each of the microservice backend,frontend and mainapp to the GCR private container registry. 

The kubectl create commands will create the pods,service and deployment of all the 3 microservices

Once the make is done, verify the pods by running 

kubectl get pods

Now,check the services by running

kubectl get services

Copy paste the external IP of the yelplabel-frontend service, which is type Load-Balancer, on to your browser, and click then Start the Labeling button.
